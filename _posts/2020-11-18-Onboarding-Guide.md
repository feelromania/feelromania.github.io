:compass: Guiding thoughts
--------------------------

*   **Take time to learn.** Don't get sucked into the minutia of decision-making or project involvement too early - there will be plenty of time for that later. In your first 30 days, try to focus on getting comfortable and learning how things work.
    
*   **Invest in relationships.** By day 60, you'll be in execution mode. In your first two months, spend as much time as you can getting to know people and forming relationships.
    
*   **Don't be afraid to ask.** No one expects you to know how things at work right away. Take advantage of that and ask for help when you need it.
